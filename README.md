Here is an Rstudio school project 
Building regression model to attempt to explain prices of the house.
The steps in the Part 1 are the following:
Predict the house price in thousands of dollars using the given features/ variables
•	Loading and studying the dataset
•	Conducting exploratory data analysis for the variables
•	Perform a correlation analysis between variables. 
•	Visualizing the correlation for the variables to identify which pairs of variables are correlated 
•	Implement linear regression with all variables and intercept to estimate the coefficients of the model defined in the previous task to predict the prices of the house.
•	Improve model
•	Plot of the original vs. the fitted values
•	Findings and results.

Part 2
Detect whether a given patient is healthy or suffers from hyperthyroidism or suffers from hypothyroidism
•	Loading and studying the dataset
•	Conducting exploratory data analysis for all variables 
•	Preparing the data for further analysis. Normalizing the data using the min-max method. 
•	Using stratified random sampling, dividing the data for training and testing as 70% of the data for the training set and 30% of the data for the test set.
•	Conducting classification with two classification models (decision trees and k-nearest neighbor) to predict the class labels. 
•	Constructing for each classifier a model that neither overfits nor underfits the data. 
•	8. Redoing the KNN classification for the original data (without scaling).
•	9. Detailed conclusion on results. 
Part 3
find similarities of different types of wine by grouping them via clustering.
•	Loading and studying the dataset 
•	Conducting exploratory data analysis for the variables
•	Using three different methods: Elbow method, Silhouette method and Gap statistic method
•	Use the optimal number of clusters for the clustering
•	Evaluate results and performance of your model
•	Detail results
